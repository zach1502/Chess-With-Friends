# Chess With Friends

## About this project
One day, I wanted to learn how to use Nodejs, and another day, I wanted to learn about making Discord bots.
So I learnt how to use Nodejs while learning how to make a Discord bot.

I like chess, so I made a chess bot.
So far it is simple, and only can do what it needs to do. Allow people to play chess with each other.
The plan is for this project to be worked on regularly over an extended period of time and see how well it goes.

Feel free to "skillfully acquire" code, just mention this repo or something idk.
Also feel free to check for malicious code.

## Getting Started!

### Step 1.  
Hopefully you have Nodejs installed. If you don't, get it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### Step 2.
Download the files from this repo and toss it into a folder.

### Step 3.
Open config.json and put int your bot token and all that. The data there doesn't work. They're there to make sure you got the right input.

### Step 4.
Double click on `install_dependencies.bat`, and it will start installing dependencies. 

### Step 5.
Double click on `start.bat`, and it will start running. 

### Step 6.
